As a developer,
I want to use Action properties
In order to retrieve related data from Trello.com.

Given an Action with a TrelloService instance
When the MemberCreator property is accessed
Then the Get<Member> method is called on the service
	And the member is returned
	And no exception is thrown.

Given an Action
When deserializing from JSON
Then the Data property is set
	And the Type property is set (need one scenario for each ActionType)
	And the Date property is set.

Given an Action with a TrelloService instance
When the Delete is called
Then the Delete<Action> method is called on the service
	And the member is returned
	And no exception is thrown.
