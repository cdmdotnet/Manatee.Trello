<p>(<a href="https://github.com/gregsdennis/Manatee.Trello/issues/310">#310</a>) Trello board download returns error: <code>invalid value for plugins</code>.  Trello recently started validating this as one of <code>[none, enabled, available, all]</code>, though what Manatee.Trello was passing (<code>true</code>) seemed to have been working.  This update changes the passed value to <code>enabled</code>, which was the originally intended functionality.

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/gregsdennis/Manatee.Trello/issues/292">#292</a>) (again) Custom field names not downloaded as part of board refresh.  Culprit was that the JSON for the board's custom fields collection wasn't being merged when the collection was updated, so items were added but not updated.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/gregsdennis/Manatee.Trello/issues/283">#283</a>) Adding attachments to cards via URLs was sad because the attachment URL wouldn't be properly encoded.  This resulted in the removal of parameters from the attachment URL (it'd be absorbed into the API URL).</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/gregsdennis/Manatee.Trello/issues/262">#262</a>) <code>TrelloFactory.Me()</code> now refreshes automatically.  Since you have to await it anyway, it was redundant to have to also call <code>await me.Refresh()</code>.</p>
<p>(<a href="https://github.com/gregsdennis/Manatee.Trello/issues/263">#263</a>) A previously-unknown notification type was found: <code>memberJoinedTrello</code>.  This is included for the member which invited someone to Trello when the invitation is accepted.</p>
<p>(<a href="https://github.com/gregsdennis/Manatee.Trello/issues/266">#266</a>) Refreshing member collections was throwing a <code>DuplicateKeyException</code> because it was trying to add the <code>fields</code> query parameter twice.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/gregsdennis/Manatee.Trello/issues/254">#254</a>) When refreshing a board's cards collection, the <code>List</code> property would end up null.  This fix corrects the query parameters to correctly return the lists.</p>

<p><span id="patch">patch</span></p>
<p>(<a href="https://github.com/gregsdennis/Manatee.Trello/issues/252">#252</a>) Collections aren't respecting the static <code>DownloadedField</code> property of the objects they were downloading.  This change adds the required query parameters to download all of the selected details.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/gregsdennis/Manatee.Trello/pull/245">PR 245</a> by <a href="https://github.com/zodchiy">@zodchiy</a>) Fixed issue with <code>Member.StarredBoards</code>.</p>
<p>(<a href="https://github.com/gregsdennis/Manatee.Trello/issues/241">#241</a>) Boards can now download most of their nested data depending on the value of the new <code>TrelloConfiguration.EnableDeepDownloads</code> static property.  By default, this property is set to true.  The effect is fully realized when <code>TrelloConfiguration.EnableConsistencyProcessing</code> (from #222) is also set to true.</p>
<p>(<a href="https://github.com/gregsdennis/Manatee.Trello/issues/222">#222 (cont.)</a>) While fixing #241, I discovered that some portions of #222 had been missed.  These have also been fixed.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>(<a href="https://github.com/gregsdennis/Manatee.Trello/issues/3">#3</a>) Support for reading, uploading, and deleting custom board backgrounds.  (Uploading new backgrounds requires a Trello Gold account.)</p>
<p>(<a href="https://github.com/gregsdennis/Manatee.Trello/issues/222">#222</a>) Entities and the collections that contain them are more relational.  For instance if a card is moved to a new list (by assigning the <code>List</code> property or by refreshing the card after an online change), the source list's card collection removes the card and the destination list's card collection adds the card.  This is performed completely internally without having to make additional API calls.  This functionality is opt-in via <code>TrelloConfiguration.EnableConsistencyProcessing</code>.</p>
<p>(<a href="https://github.com/gregsdennis/Manatee.Trello/issues/235">#235</a>) An issue was discovered where refreshing collections would not raise the <code>Updated</code> event on the entities that owned them.  For instance, when a list is refreshed, it fetches the cards as part of the call and the event is raised with &quot;Cards&quot; in the list of properties that updated.  But if the <code>Cards</code> property were directly refreshed, the event would not be raised.  Also, none of the collections expose an <code>Updated</code> event.  This results in no notification that an update as occurred.  This change raises the event on the entity (in this case, the list) when any of its collections are updated.</p>
<p>(<a href="https://github.com/gregsdennis/Manatee.Trello/issues/227">#227</a>) When copying cards, it's possible to indicate what subset of additional data to copy besides merely property information. Any combination of attachments, checklists, comments, due date,labels, members, and stickers are supported.  This change adds an optional <code>keep</code> parameter to the <code>CardCollection.Add()</code> overload that takes a source card to duplicate.</p>
<p>(<a href="https://github.com/gregsdennis/Manatee.Trello/issues/239">#239</a>) Trello supports up to 10 items to be retrieved simultaneously through a single bulk call.  To support this, several changes have been introduced, most notably <code>TrelloProcessor.Refresh()</code> which takes a collection of entities and manages them into appropriate batches based on size and authorization, if multiple authorizations have been used.</p>

<p>(<a href="https://github.com/gregsdennis/Manatee.Trello/issues/224">#224</a>) Updated collection <code>Add()</code> methods to include optional parameters so that the data can be included as part of the creation process rather than having to set properties which would require at least one additional call.</p>
<p>(<a href="https://github.com/gregsdennis/Manatee.Trello/issues/211">#211</a>) All entities and collections can now be forcibly refreshed.</p>

<h1 id="3012">3.0.12</h1>
<p><em>Released on 30 May, 2018.</em></p>
<p><span id="feature">feature</span> <span id="patch">patch</span></p>
<p>Fixes issue for webhook processing where the property list provided by the event were inaccurate.  Also resolves an issue of updating cached entities with potentially stale data downloaded from <code>Action</code>s that indicated past activities.  <strong>As a result, <code>Action.Data</code> and <code>Notification.Data</code> no longer use cached entities.</strong></p>
<p>Additionally, the properties reported for sub-entities (e.g. <code>Card.Badges</code>) are now prefixed with the container property.  So if <code>Card.Badges.Comments</code> (a count of the comments on the card) changes, the <code>Card.Updated</code> event would report that <code>Badges.Comments</code> was updated.  Previously, the property report would be only <code>Comments</code> which conflicts with the <code>Card.Comments</code> property.</p>
<p>Fixed a deserialization issue for cards.  <code>ShortLink</code> does not directly translate to <code>ShortUrl</code> and needs some formatting.</p>
<p><code>Refresh()</code> on collection types is no longer virtual.  (Should have been sealed on all implementations anyway.)</p>

<p><em>Released on 18 May, 2018.</em></p>

<h1 id="300">3.0.0</h1>
<p><em>Released on 27 Apr, 2018.</em></p>
<p><span id="break">breaking change</span> <span id="trello">trello</span> <span id="feature">feature</span> <span id="patch">patch</span></p>
<h2 id="supported-frameworks">Supported frameworks</h2>
<p>Now multi-targets:</p>
<ul>
<li>.Net Framework 4.5</li>
<li>.Net Standard 1.3</li>
<li>.Net Standard 2.0</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="added-asynchronous-processing">Added asynchronous processing</h2>
<p>All methods that perform requests (<code>Refresh()</code>, <code>Delete()</code>, collection <code>Add()</code> methods, etc.) are now async methods and should be awaited.</p>
<p>Request processing no longer occurs in a queue.  Instead, the .Net <em>async/await</em> model is used.</p>
<h2 id="data-access">Data access</h2>
<p>Getting properties no longer produces requests.  Calling <code>Refresh()</code> is required.</p>
<p>Setting properties works as before.</p>
<p>When refreshing entities and collections, more data is downloaded with a single call.  Additionally, all data is used to update any available entities.  This results in fewer required calls.</p>
<h2 id="entities">Entities</h2>
<p>Interfaces have been extracted for all entities to support unit testing.</p>
<p>All properties have been altered to return interfaces rather than concrete types.</p>
<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>
<p>Added <code>RefreshThrottle</code> to limit successive GET requests.
Added <code>RemoveDeletedItemsFromCache</code> to optionally keep deleted entities in the cache.
Removed <code>ExpiryTime</code> in conjuction with changes to property getters.</p>
<h2 id="libraries">Libraries</h2>
<p>The following libraries have been consolidated into the main library:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Manatee.Trello.ManateeJson</em></li>
<li><em>Manatee.Trello.WebApi</em></li>
<li><em>Manatee.Trello.CustomFields</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The configuration seams for these libraries are still available if alternate solutions are desired.</p>
<h3 id="additional-changes">Additional changes</h3>
<p>Custom fields are now writable.</p>
